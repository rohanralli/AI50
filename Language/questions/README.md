The "Questions" project from HarvardX's CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python focuses on developing a question-answering system using natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to build a program that can analyze a corpus of text documents and answer user queries by retrieving the most relevant information.

Project Description
In this project, you will implement an information retrieval system that takes a user’s question and finds the most relevant passages from a set of text documents. The system relies on tokenization, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and cosine similarity to determine the relevance of a passage to the given question.

Key Learning Objectives
  Understand the principles of natural language processing (NLP).
  Learn how to use tokenization and stemming to process text data.
  Implement TF-IDF vectorization to assess the importance of words in a document.
  Compute cosine similarity to compare text passages.
  Develop a question-answering system that selects the most relevant passage from a corpus.
Technical Implementation
  Load and process multiple text documents.
  Tokenize words using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).
  Compute TF-IDF scores to weigh the importance of words.
  Use cosine similarity to measure relevance between the question and text passages.
  Return the most relevant passage as the answer.
Skills Developed
  NLP techniques (Tokenization, Stemming, Stopword Removal)
  Text processing with Python and NLTK
  Mathematical foundations of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
  Information retrieval systems (basic search engine concepts)
Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have built a functional question-answering system that can analyze a set of documents and retrieve the most relevant response to a given query. This project introduces fundamental AI concepts used in search engines, chatbots, and intelligent assistants.
